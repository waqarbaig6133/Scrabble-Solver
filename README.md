Using the NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) library to get access to possibly all of the english words, this program allows you generate all of the possible words that the letters in front you in the game Scrabble can be made. Sorting the list based on the word length makes it easier to find the word with the highest point. Do not use this in an actual game as I do not condone cheating. This is just an idea that I thought would be interesting. Though one thing to keep in mind is that not everyword in the English language is part of Scrabble's lexicon, such as Pungi, which is the name of an Indian flute. There is also the question of whether that word could fit anywhere in the board

If you want to use the code, you may need to run it on something like replit like me because a lot of people including are having problems running this thing on desktop IDEs
